## Crypto is Not Just for Monkeys

I’ve been the victim of rug pulls, smart contract exploits and collapsed exchanges. I still have hope for crypto’s future. 

Crypto provides a smorgasbord of entertaining options for people willing to part with their money. As a crypto investor, you have a standing invite to YOLO into a variety of illiquid, dog-themed tokens using 100x leverage. You can also try your hand at timing the perfect exit from a selection of functionally-identical Ponzi investments. If you’re not into strategy, you can reliably acquire an unreasonably priced image of a monkey from all good NFT retailers. 

The crypto investment game is multi-levelled. In expert mode, you lose the centralised guard rails and interact directly with the blockchain.  This requires constant vigilance. A chatroom stranger sharing an unsolicited link will lead to emptied wallets. An unaudited smart contract is an open challenge to an army of hobbyist hackers. A spike in demand for block space will 100x the cost of any transaction. Robots quite literally battle to front run transactions and sandwich attack trades. 

But crypto also has a lesser known, non-speculative side - decentralised applications (dApps). dApps dispense services like vending machines dispense chocolates. Financial dApps have seen modest successes - with top collateralised lenders having matched borrowers with several billion dollars from crowdsourced stablecoin pools (generating millions in unsubsidised fees and interest for depositors per day). In these cases, there is nothing but smart contract code managing the process (from deposits to redemption, setting rates to routing interest, and from managing risk to liquidating collateral). 

Another non-speculative creature of crypto is the decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO). A DAO is like a vending machine for board room decisions. A community of project contributors stocks the DAO full of ideas, and makes them available for all project stakeholders to browse and select. In many DAOs, the selection of an idea by a proper quorum of stakeholders results in the automatic execution of a governance action (for example, a transfer of funds to a service provider). Certain governance actions are made cryptographically impossible without stakeholder approval.  

Whether the future of organisations and the services sector will be dominated by vending machines is far from certain.  Whether such a future would be a utopian paradise or dystopian nightmare is up for debate. In any event, crypto provides a much richer platform for human inginuity than monkeys.
